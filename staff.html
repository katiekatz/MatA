He has spent the last nine years performing scenes, improv, and stage combat at the New York Renaissance Faire in roles such as Robin Hood, William Shakespeare, and a turnip farmer. In that time he has worked with and learned from countless individuals in the New York City professional theater community, from experienced Disney leaders to primetime television writers and fight masters in the Society of American Fight Directors. In 2013 he received his Master’s in Education at Hunter College, and has taught middle school and high school English in the Bronx and Harlem since. This year he has had the pleasure of adding Shakespeare and theater to his curriculum.
