It will be geared towards all skill levels; no prior experience is necessary, and intermediate and advanced students are welcome to take the opportunity to refine their technique. We’ll begin with a warm-up, before moving on to basic rolls, cartwheels, and breakfalls. Techniques and skills can be adapted and altered to better fit the specific needs and aptitudes of each student.</div>

I use these terms to help my students to connect deeply to their music and to play action in order to achieve their objective.</div>

                <div class="panel-body">Run by Dave Milo<br>The Physicality of Theater is a workshop designed to strengthen an actor’s awareness of their body and its capabilities for storytelling. Participants will practice altering their posture, movement patterns, and expressions beyond their comfort zones in order to facilitate a complete transformation. Activities will include full-body stretching, silent storytelling and communication, movement and stride training, and others designed to extend an actor’s range and confidence in their body. Comfortable clothing is needed, as the workshop will consist of many movement based exercises.
