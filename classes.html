                    <ul>
                        <li>Objective-what the performer wants while performing their music</li>

                        <li>Personal source</li>
                    </ul>These terms are taken from the Moscow Arts theatre in Russia, taught by the master teacher Constantine Stanislavsky at the end of the 19th century. I use these terms to help my students to connect deeply to their music and to play action in order to achieve their objective.</div>

Comfortable clothing is needed, as the workshop will consist of many movement based exercises.

Much like this idiom, Shakespeare's characters live in a world where thought, word and deed are intricately connected. For actors deciphering these worlds and characters it is helpful to think of this idiom (somewhat) in reverse. Watch your words, they become thoughts. Watch your thoughts, they become deeds. Watch your deeds, they become your character. We will spend some time looking at Shakespeare's text and exploring some tools to help us tease apart a soliloquy in search of a character.
