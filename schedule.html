                    <h2>The Physicality of Theatre</h2>
                    <h5>The Physicality of Theater is a workshop designed to strengthen an actor's awareness of their body and its capabilities for storytelling. Participants will practice altering their posture, movement patterns, and expressions beyond their comfort zones in order to facilitate a complete transformation. Activities will include full-body stretching, silent storytelling and communication, movement and stride training, and others designed to extend an actor's range and confidence in their body. Comfortable clothing is needed, as the workshop will consist of many movement based exercises.

                    <h5>Watch your thoughts. They become words. Watch your words. They become deeds. Watch your deeds. They become your character. Much like this idiom, Shakespeare's characters live in a world where thought, word and deed are intricately connected. For actors deciphering these worlds and characters it is helpful to think of this idiom (somewhat) in reverse. Watch your words, they become thoughts. Watch your thoughts, they become deeds. Watch your deeds, they become your character. We will spend some time looking at Shakespeare's text and exploring some tools to help us tease apart a soliloquy in search of a character.</h5>

He currently resides in NJ with his wife and cat while he pursues the life of an actor in New York City with all that that entails (for instance he can tell you where just about every Starbucks in midtown Manhattan is located).

                    <h5>During this workshop I will teach what I consider the four basic essential components of performance that can be used in many different styles of music:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Objective-what the performer wants while performing their music</li>
                            <li>Obstacle- what stands in the way of achieving your objective</li>
                            <li>Action- the means of achieving your objective.</li>
                            <li>Personal source</li>
                        </ul>These terms are taken from the Moscow Arts theatre in Russia, taught by the master teacher Constantine Stanislavsky at the end of the 19th century. I use these terms to help my students to connect deeply to their music and to play action in order to achieve their objective.</h5>
