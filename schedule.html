                    <h2>The Physicality of Theatre</h2>
                    <h5>The Physicality of Theater is a workshop designed to strengthen an actor's awareness of their body and its capabilities for storytelling. Participants will practice altering their posture, movement patterns, and expressions beyond their comfort zones in order to facilitate a complete transformation. Activities will include full-body stretching, silent storytelling and communication, movement and stride training, and others designed to extend an actor's range and confidence in their body. Comfortable clothing is needed, as the workshop will consist of many movement based exercises.

                    <h2>Dave Milo</h2>
                    <h5>Dave Milo has been performing in theater for most of his life, beginning long ago at the Actors' Cafe in Bradley Beach, New Jersey. He has spent the last nine years performing scenes, improv, and stage combat at the New York Renaissance Faire in roles such as Robin Hood, William Shakespeare, and a turnip farmer. In that time he has worked with and learned from countless individuals in the New York City professional theater community, from experienced Disney leaders to primetime television writers and fight masters in the Society of American Fight Directors. In 2013 he received his Master's in Education at Hunter College, and has taught middle school and high school English in the Bronx and Harlem since. This year he has had the pleasure of adding Shakespeare and theater to his curriculum.

                    <h5>Watch your thoughts. They become words. Watch your words. They become deeds. Watch your deeds. They become your character. Much like this idiom, Shakespeare's characters live in a world where thought, word and deed are intricately connected. For actors deciphering these worlds and characters it is helpful to think of this idiom (somewhat) in reverse. Watch your words, they become thoughts. Watch your thoughts, they become deeds. Watch your deeds, they become your character. We will spend some time looking at Shakespeare's text and exploring some tools to help us tease apart a soliloquy in search of a character.</h5>

                    <h5>Glenn Stott has an B.A. in psychology from Swarthmore college where he helped found a student run Shakespeare theater dedicated to the idea that Shakespeare was a) meant to be seen not simply read, and b) for everyone. He went on to study at the London Academy of Dramatic Arts (three guesses as to where it’s located) before getting his M.A. in acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. He currently resides in NJ with his wife and cat while he pursues the life of an actor in New York City with all that that entails (for instance he can tell you where just about every Starbucks in midtown Manhattan is located).

With their different backgrounds and unique perspectives, they focus on giving students the groundwork needed to hone their skills through individual practice and hard work. Combined, they have over 23 years of teaching experience and a lifetime each of performing. Currently, they offer donation based seminars once a month in Harrington Park.
